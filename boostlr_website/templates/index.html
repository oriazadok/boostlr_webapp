                Label ranking is a machine learning task focused on ordering a set of labels based on their relevance to a specific data instance.
                This problem is prevalent in various fields such as microbiology, image recognition, meta-learning, and text classification.
                Traditional boosting algorithms like AdaBoost are not tailored for label ranking, resulting in less accurate and efficient solutions.
                BoostLR addresses these challenges with innovative enhancements designed specifically for ranking labels.
